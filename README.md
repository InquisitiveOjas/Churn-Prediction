# Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction is one of the most well known applications of machine learning and data science in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Marketing fields. This project uses Artificial Neural Network for Churn Prediction.
A Predictive Churn Model is a tool that defines the steps and stages of customer churn, or a customer leaving your service or product. 
Having a predictive churn model gives you awareness and quantifiable metrics to fight against in your retention efforts. Without this tool, you would be acting on broad assumptions, not a data-driven model that reflects how your customers really act. 
But with an evolving churn model, you can fight for retention by acting on the metrics as they happen. 
This gives you the ability to pattern habits of customers who leave, and step in before they make that decision.

This project implements the churn modeling idea using Artificial Neural Networks.
The code is divided into 3 parts:- (1)Data Preprocessing (2)ANN model (3)Making the predictions and evaluating the model

This project also implements the same model using XGBoost.
XGBoost is short for eXtreme gradient boosting. It is a library designed and optimized for boosted tree algorithms.
It's main goal is to push the extreme of the computation limits of machines to provide a scalable, portable and accurate for large scale tree boosting.
XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. 
It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. 
XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.
